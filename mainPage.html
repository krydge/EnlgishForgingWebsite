        <div class="design">
            <p>Start by designing the blade you want.<br>Ask yourself what will you use this blade for.<br>Draw a design. Figue out its size.<br>Determine what metal you will use.<br>Determine the order you will use to make the blade.</p>
            <img src="Blade Edges.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="forging">
        <h2>Forging</h2>
        <p>Bring the steel to heat using the forge. Use the hammer, tongs, and anvil to shape the blade. This will take many reheats in the forge. Donâ€™t work the metal when it is cool
        </p>
  
    </div>
    <div class="normalizing">
        <h2>Normalizing</h2>
        <p>Once the Blade is close to the shape you want you to put it back in the forge to heat then let it slowly cool of. This lets the metal relax and realign. Do this a few times.
        </p>
 
    </div>
    <div class="quenching">
        <h2>Quenching</h2>
        <p>Following the Normalizing, you need to harden the bade or Quench it. This is what allows the blade to retain a sharp edge. To do so you need to heat the blade to between 1500 and 1600 Fahrenheit. Some people use a magnet to check the temp because at the right temperature steel is no longer magnetic. Once it is at temp submerge the blade in the oil and move it around until it is cool.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="tempering">
        <h2>Tempering</h2>
        <p>Quickly after Quenching the blade, 
            we need to soften it so it does not crack. 
            To do so put it in an oven at 400 degrees for two hours. You should do this two times. This keeps the blade hard but less lily to break</p>

    </div>
    <div class="sharpening">
        <h2>Sharpening</h2>
        <p>Now it is time to make it a usable tool by sharpening the blade. This can take some time but is what completes the process.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="safety">
        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>Forging is always dangerous. Always take precautions. Use the PPE and keep things safe. Safety is always the responsibility of the individual and you ned to watch waht the people around you are doing. Be aware of your surroundings.</p>
